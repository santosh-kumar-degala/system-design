API Gateway is a single entry point for all client requests. Handles routing, filtering, and load balancing.

An API gateway is a server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing throttling and security policies, passing requests to the back-end service, and then returning the appropriate result to the client. 
 
It is essentially a middleman between the client and the server, managing and optimizing API traffic. 

Key Functions of an API Gateway:
ðŸ”¹ Request Routing: Directs incoming API requests to the appropriate backend service. 
ðŸ”¹ Load Balancing: Distributes requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. 
ðŸ”¹ Security: Implements security measures like authentication, authorization, and data encryption. 
ðŸ”¹ Rate Limiting and Throttling: Controls the number of requests a client can make within a certain period. 
ðŸ”¹ API Composition: Combines multiple backend API requests into a single frontend request to optimize performance. 
ðŸ”¹ Caching: Stores responses temporarily to reduce the need for repeated processing.
